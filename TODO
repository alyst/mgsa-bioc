Grid for alpha, beta p:
------------------------

Julien:
Alpha, beta and p are numeric vectors of any length both for the discrete and for the continuous case.
For the continuous case, these (except the last one) define the breaks of the histogram.
For the discrete case, these (including the last one) define the grid. 

That way we do not have to add further parameters for the histogram.

Fine or too cumbersome?
alternative?

Seb:
I think so, at least it is very complicated to specify a continuous range
then ;)

Julien:
do you know seq(0,1,length.out=11) ?


mgsa(o,...)
-----------

Why do we have mgsa(o,...) with o numeric and with o integer? One of them should be enough.
In theory these should be integer, so forcing them to be integer is safer.
On the other hand, since any integer is a numeric, we can simply offer the numeric signature.

method for MgsaSets:
------------------
length (number of sets)
subsetting sets?

the method getSubMapping does not correctly populate the slots "setAnnotations" and "itemAnnotations"
