mgsa(o,...)
-----------

include "type_of_prior" (logical) to define whether we use a discrete or a continuous prior on the parameters

Why do we have mgsa(o,...) with o numeric and with o integer? One of them should be enough.
In theory these should be integer, so forcing them to be integer is safer.
On the other hand, since any integer is a numeric, we can simply offer the numeric signature.

method for MgsaSets:
length (number of sets)
subsetting sets?

the method getSubMapping does not correctly populate the slots "setAnnotations" and "itemAnnotations"
