mgsa(o,...)
-----------

include "type_of_prior" (logical) to define whether we use a discrete or a continuous prior on the parameters

Why do we have mgsa(o,...) with o numeric and with o integer? One of them should be enough.
In theory these should be integer, so forcing them to be integer is safer.
On the other hand, since any integer is a numeric, we can simply offer the numeric signature.

shall we provide 3 (or 5) restarts by default?


method for MgsaSets:
print or show
length (number of sets)
subsetting sets?
we could have MgsaSets that contains "list" and then inherit from lapply, length, automatically.
we only to replace all @sets into @.Data in the code and have for def: 

setClass(
        Class="MgsaSets",
        representation = representation(
							# maps any item name to an item index
							itemName2ItemIndex = "integer",

							# total number of items 
							numberOfItems = "integer",

							# Same order as sets
							setAnnotations = "data.frame",
			
							# Rows are ordered according to item indices and contain the item annotations
							itemAnnotations = "data.frame"
			)
			contains = "list"
)


the method getSubMapping does not correctly populate the slots "setAnnotations" and "itemAnnotations"
